# Qualifile
Qualifile is an educational platform that provides students to learn any course and get skills and specialization. Special thing in this platform is that meaningful educational transactions are stored in decentralized database (Fluence), so your results can't be accidetaly removed or faked. After course is completed, student can release his certificate that contains overall result for the course. It displays average score of all student's tasks and is stored permanently in Arweave, so it also cannot be removed or be fake. We expect that this educational process with confirmed and unforgeable results will create more trust to the results of such education, so usage of the platform is to become a standart of remote education.
